# USE INTENTION-REVEALING NAMES

Name of the variable, function or class should answer all the big questions:
1. Why it exists?
2. What it does?
3. How it is used?

- If a name requires a comment, then the name doesn't reveal the intent!
- Avoid disinformation
- use pronounceable names, avoid names that are dis-informative as well as non-informative
- distinguish names in such a way that the reader knows what the differences offer
- use searchable names
- single-letter names can ONLY be used as local variables inside short methods. The length of the name
should correspond to the size of its scope. If a variable or constant might be seen or used
in multiple places in a body of code, it is imperative to give it a search-friendly name
- avoid encodings,
