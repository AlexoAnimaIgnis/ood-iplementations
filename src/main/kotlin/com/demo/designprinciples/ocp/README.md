Software Modules should be open for extension and closed for modification
- closest to software testing
- software should be designed in such a way that new functionalities should cause minimum changes to already working
and tested software functionalities. Software developers should be able to change the environment surrounding a module rather
than changing the module itself
- cost of modifying fully functioning and well tested components to support new requirements is high
- related to strategy design pattern
